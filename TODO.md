Deterministic solution path
---------------------------

Essentially, we should ensure we provide a way to deterministically figure out the killer. Produce a list of criterias for the murder to have been committed and ensure only the real killer matches all of them.

This is the last remaining must-have for the output to be useable.

More relationship types
-----------------------

We need at least 5 or 6 as a minimum to make the case feel realistic

Unit tests
----------

We should have some tests for as much of our logic as possible, to make community participation easier and to reduce the number of bugs.

Input processing
----------------

The user should be able to feed a config file into the application to control how the output looks.

There is some very basic groundwork done for this, but it would be nice to actually finish it


Simple tasks
------------

There are always staple tasks to do which do not involve messing heavily with new algorithms, but helps create a better program nonetheless.

Such tasks include:
* Adding new relationship types
* Adding new first and last names
* Refining existing rules (for instance, adding a new criteria to an existing relationship to remove some illogical scenarios)
* ...more tasks will come up as the engine develops

Any contribution, however minor, is helpful. The more information we input into the system, the better the output will be. Pick something that seems fun and hack away!
