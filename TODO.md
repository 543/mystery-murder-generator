Deterministic solution path
---------------------------

Essentially, we should ensure we provide a way to deterministically figure out the killer. Produce a list of criterias for the murder to have been committed and ensure only the real killer matches all of them.

This is the last remaining must-have for the output to be useable.

More relationship types
-----------------------

We need at least 5 or 6 as a minimum to make the case feel realistic

Unit tests
----------

We should have some tests for as much of our logic as possible, to make community participation easier and to reduce the number of bugs.

Input processing
----------------

The user should be able to feed a config file into the application to control how the output looks.

There is some very basic groundwork done for this, but it would be nice to actually finish it
