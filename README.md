mystery-murder-generator
========================

An attempt to generate mystery murder game procedurally.

The plan is to produce generic output, detailing events, characters, etc.

The output can then be fed into other programs dealing with things like NLP (to create a story from it) or a game engine (to create a mystery game)

How to run
----------
> python3 -m mmgen

To use a custom specfile:
> python3 -m mmgen myspecfile
